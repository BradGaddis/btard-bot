# BTarded Trading Bot
### My name is Brad and the name of this project is a meme


### Disclaimer
    You will lose money. 
    Especially if you attempt to use this program without doing your own due diligence. 
    When you lose money, it will not be my fault. You understand the risks. This is MY project.
    I intend to lose my own money; Not yours. 
    
    That said, do as you will. It's your money. 

## What this is:
    This program is a project that I want to build in my spare time. I hope to build a trading bot that uses reinforcement deeplearning to make better and better trades. 

    I am broke. I want to train this project with the Alpaca API and get filthy stinking rich (like everyone else, obviously). 

    This application may or may not be open-sourced. I haven't decided on that just yet.  


## Standing principles:
    * If I leave this open-source, I hope to make every dependency required to use this free of charge.
        * If this is not possible, then I hope to keep the cost minimal
