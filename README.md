# BTarded Trading Bot
### My name is Brad and the name of this project is a meme

    This program is a project that I want to build in my spare time. I hope to build a trading bot that uses reinforcement deeplearning to make better and better trades. 

    I am broke. I want to train this project with the Alpaca API and get filthy stinking rich (like everyone else, obviously). 

    This application may or may not be open-sourced. I haven't decided on that just yet.  


## Standing principles:
    * If I leave this open-source, I hope to make every dependency required to use this free of charge.
        * If this is not possible, then I hope to keep the cost minimal
